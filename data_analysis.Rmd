Some R packages we will be using for the workshop. Feel free to add others during the session. 

```{r setup}
library(here)
library(dplyr)
library(RSocrata)
```

The dataset we will be using is the State Expenditures data set, which you can load into your R session by passing the URL to `RSocrata::read.socrata()`. 

```{r load-expenditure-data}
state_expenditures <- read.socrata("https://data.oregon.gov/Revenue-Expense/Agency-Expenditures-Multi-Year-Report/y9g9-xsxs")

state_expenditures
```
